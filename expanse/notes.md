## `srun` Options

-   `-n, --ntasks` How many tasks will be run? 
(see also `--cpus-per-task`)
-   `-N, --nodes` This is the amount of nodes it will request. By default this is the minimum number of nodes, but a max can also be specified
Srun options superscede sbatch
-   `--cpu-bind=rank` This makes the job actually run though I don't know why


1 Magnet PS
    - Rate needs to be careful 
    - Actually dangerous, RTFM
    - Make sure we have quench protection and everything
    - QUENCH DETECTION/prevention 
    - Talk to Aritra and Neil

2 Noise Board
3 Real Time Graphs

Two fluid model, leakage across region caused by normal quasiparticles, n_n and n_s

RP:
Different source for ref. 1
NSF-y, evaluating if its somthing that is clearly understood
capable of performing the work
Advance knowledge/understanding
benifit society
Why is it createive and original 
Well reasoned, organized, sound rationale
How well qualified am I?
Do I have the resources I need

Incorperate aims into it but 
Add more about background
For resources, what would I require?
Will I need comsol?
Simulation types?
What kind of computing resources?

BI shorter than IM 

75% shorter

BI
    - Provide avenue for underrepresented
    - outreach done as part of it
    - Seminars? Thats a BI!
    - Beyond the grad level research, somthing lower level
    - Simple models of SC for students
    - PHET is broader impact, SC in PHET?

Model Dayem bridge
 1. Small chunks
 2. Reproduce biswas paper
 3. GL to physical dimensions
    a. Ask aritra about his GL in comsol
    b. Learn about comsol


 Temper expectations, don't push myself tho
